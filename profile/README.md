# The PASTA-Toolbox
PASTA is short for **Pa**rallel **St**ring **A**lgorithms. The PASTA-Toolbox will be home to many different algorithms that work on strings, focusing on parallel algorithms that work well in shared and distributed memory.
The main goal is to provide modular implementations of basic algorithms and data structures that can easily be combined to larger and more complex applications.

This project is in a very early stage. Right now, there is a lot of work done behind the scenes to get a great initial release going, so stay tuned! If you are interested in contributing, please contact [me](mailto:florian@kurpicz.org). In the meantime, you may want to look at our most recent work on [wavelet tree construction], [suffix sorting], and [longest common extension queries].
